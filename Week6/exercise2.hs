Exercise 2

When I said “we” in the previous sentence I actually meant “you”.
Your task for this exercise is to come up with more efficient implementation.

Specifically, define the infinite list

fibs2 :: [Integer]

so that it has the same elements as fibs1, but computing the first n
elements of fibs2 requires only O(n) addition operations. Be sure to
use standard recursion pattern(s) from the Prelude as appropriate.

fib :: Integer -> Integer

fibs1 :: [Integer]

fibs2 :: [Integer]
